# HTML5-Signature-Pad

There was a need to integrate a signature capturing device to a web app. This proved that I had to choose a vendor for the device, 
then write code for my web app to interact with the API, essentially losing all the benefits of a web app.

Lucky for me the customer had touch screen laptops and tables, so I came up with a way where I capture their signature by making them sign on a html canvas and then capture it as a gif/png to record the signature.

I drew inspiration from various projects posted online and I have my own implementation. Feel free to fork and comment.
